Penn Animal Advocacy works to publicize ways to achieve the greatest possible improvement in animal treatment given our limited resources. 
 
Animals are often raised in horrific conditions in the meat industry, and over 56 billion farmed animals are killed each year.
For people interested in working to improve the lives of animals, there are countless organizations to choose to support, and it can be difficult to know which ones are most effective.
 
There are many different approaches that animal charities take, such as:
 
- Legal action: Many animal charities bring lawsuits to try and change conditions in factory farms or to try and change the status that animals hold under the law.
- Education: Animal charities often try to affect the cultural attitude towards animals and the meat industry by handing out pamphlets of information or holding events that they hope individuals on the fence about animal causes will attend.
- Animal Rescue: Some charities work to save as many farm animals (and abandoned domesticated animals) as they can, not only for the sake of the animals, but also so they can sometimes have the public interact with farm animals to realize that they are more than objects.
- Industry exposé: Organizations infiltrate factory farms (often at legal risk themselves) in order to take videos of conditions in the hope of affecting the public’s opinion of the meat industry.
 
There are many more approaches, but these seem to be the recurring ones among numerous charities.
People disagree about which approach is most effective, but in general, the most effective animal charities spend some money on a wide variety of approaches, in order to have the greatest impact on culture and industry.
 
[Animal Charity Evaluators](animalcharityevaluators.org) is a very helpful organization that researches many animal charities, determines what they are spending their money on, and how effectively they are spending that money.
On their website, you can see the distribution of spending by the top charities, and which organizations were able to spend the least money in affecting the most change.

You may disagree about which charities are most effective, but remember to research the financial effectiveness of whichever group you choose to donate to.
