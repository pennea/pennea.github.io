You have 80,000 Hours in your career.
Choose how you spend that time well, and you’ll have a huge positive impact on the world.
Choose badly and you might not achieve much at all.

80,000 Hours is an organization dedicated to helping you have the largest positive impact with your career.
It has been researching the highest impact careers for four years with academics at the University of Oxford and their advice is tailored for talented young graduates. 

All of 80,000 Hours’ research is available for free at their website.
Their career guide takes you through the key steps to think about while choosing a career, and they provide profiles on many of the highest impact careers that they have found.
Check out the [website](https://80000hours.org/).

Last semester we ran a pilot careers coaching program at Penn, using the 80,000 Hours framework to help students to identify which career they can have the greatest impact in.
We are looking to provide a similar program this semester for a limited number of people.
If you are interested in this, please get in touch.
