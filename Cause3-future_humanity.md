Many people want their careers to work towards the alleviation of some giant real-world problem that affects all of humanity. Maybe it’s environmental advocacy and policy-setting. Maybe the study, prevention, and curing of disease. Many such problems exist, but some have far fewer people working on them or have outsized potential impact on humanity’s fate and future. The purpose of the Future of Humanity Society is to analyze all such global existential problems and, applying an effective altruist mindset, and increase our relevant skill sets such that we can make a difference on these massive issues.

We host discussions, speaker events, and study groups on the topics and fields of study that are most critical to humanity’s long-term survival, including artificial intelligence, epidemiology, nanotechnology, synthetic biology, nuclear arms proliferation, and more.
