We are a global community, not just another charity.

For one thing, we don’t want your money.
We’re a global community of people committed to giving part of our income in the most effective way possible.We recommend the most effective charities working to help people in developing countries.
The best research in effectiveness can help you to make the biggest possible difference with your money.

###Research Effective Charities
With people dying every day of preventable diseases and malnutrition, it is critical that we donate to the most effective charities possible.
The difference between charities is astounding.
Some do 1,000 times as much good with their donations as others!
There are many sources that evaluate effectiveness of charities.
Our biggest source of information, particularly for determining our charity recommendations, is the US charity evaluator [GiveWell][givewell].
Their rigorous research methodology focused on determining the overall good done by programs, combined with a strong commitment to transparency and the resources to investigate charities extremely thoroughly, make them an invaluable resource for determining the best charities to donate to.


###Taking the pledge
Our working members who have taken the pledge give at least 10% of their income to the most effective charities.
Together, we can eliminate extreme poverty within this lifetime.
Students at Penn who choose to take it have pledged 1% of their disposable income during their time as an undergraduate and at least 10% of their income after graduation.
To join Giving What We Can at Penn does not require you to take the pledge, but it will be a wonderful way to learn more about the organization and considering it in the future.
