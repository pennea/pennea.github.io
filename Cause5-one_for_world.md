One for the World is a movement at The Wharton School to make effective charitable giving part of our everyday lives. 

It was founded in 2014 by two MBA students, and encourages graduating MBAs to pledge to give 1% of their future incomes to effective charities.
In 2014, 45 graduating students took this pledge and this increased to 105 graduating students in 2015, meaning One for the World has reached 150 members in just 18 months.

One for the World conducts a research and due diligence process each year to select which charities are in its portfolio of recommendations, and currently recommends 4 organizations:

- Against Malaria Foundation
- Evidence Action
- Schistosomiasis Control Initiative
- Living Goods

One for the World has recently expanded to Harvard Business School, and is looking to expand to Penn Law and Wharton undergraduates this year.
