Penn Animal Advocacy will be hosting a Vegan Thanksgiving dinner and documentary on campus this Sunday!

We will be cooking a roast dinner on campus, and showing the 2013 documentary by Mark Devries, Speciesism: The Movie. This film follows a young man as he investigates the world of factory farming, and a growing political and intellectual movement that considers animals as important as humans. It has a rating of 8.4 on IMDB and is a fun, disturbing and thought-provoking look at the farming industry and animal advocacy movement. 

Please email us at pennanimaladvocacy@gmail.com if you are interested in coming, so we know how much food to buy. All are welcome (and feel free to bring friends along too!).
