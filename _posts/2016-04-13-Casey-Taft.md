Dr. Casey Taft, a professor of Psychiatry at Boston University School of Medicine and co-owner of Vegan Publishers, will be presenting at the University of Pennsylvania on his new book, “Motivational Methods for Vegan Advocacy: A Clinical Psychology Perspective.” His talk will explore how we can best help nonhuman animals.

Many people strive for effectiveness, but Dr. Casey Taft believes that several current claims of effective practices lack meaningful scientific support. He will present what he has concluded to be the most effective strategies for behavioral change, based on his years of experience working to prevent domestic violence and abuse. 

There will be time for questions and discussion after the talk. Dr. Taft will also be selling and signing copies of his book if you wish to find out more about his ideas.

The event will be catered with vegan food by local Philadelphia restaurants, and is kindly sponsored by Graduate and Professional Student Assembly (GAPSA)
