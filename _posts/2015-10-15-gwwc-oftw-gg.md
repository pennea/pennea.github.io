Our first giving game of the year, hosted by our brand new commitee!

Come learn about Giving What We Can, effective altruism and three of the world's most effective charities and chat over dinner from Blackbird Pizza! You will have the opportunity to vote for one of the charities at the end and each vote will translate to $10 dollars in donations by our external donor. Come and make your vote count!

We will present evidence on three highly effective charities
focusing on a different aspect of alleviating extreme poverty.

- The Against Malaria Foundation
- SCI (Schistosomiasis Control Initiative)
- Living Goods

We are excited to announce that we will be launching a new initiative at the event this evening, One for the World (OFTW). OFTW was founded in 2014 by 2 Wharton MBA students who wanted to create a culture of effective philanthropy among MBA students. In its first 18 months, over 150 MBA students have pledged 1% of their earnings after graduation to the worldâ€™s most effective charities.

Giving What We Can: Penn is launching OFTW for the rest of Penn, and we are recruiting people to help expand this at the undergraduate level.

To find out more, come to the Giving Game tonight - One for the World MBA board members will be speaking, and all three of the charities in the Giving Game are recommended by One for the World. Also check out the website: 1fortheworld.org
