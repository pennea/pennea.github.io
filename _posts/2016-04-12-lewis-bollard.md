The Most Good You Can Do: Helping Animals Effectively. 

What is the most effective way to help animals? Should we try to persuade people to reduce their meat consumption, or is promoting veganism more effective? Do advocacy methods such as leafleting or online ads create dietary change? Should we focus on corporate campaigns to improve the welfare of farmed animals? Or should we try a different approach altogether?

Join us for a talk with Lewis Bollard on Tuesday, April 12. He will be speaking about his work with the Open Philanthropy Project, a collaboration between Good Ventures and GiveWell which aims to identify outstanding giving opportunities, make grants and publish their findings.

Lewis Bollard leads the Open Philanthropy Project’s strategy for Farm Animal Welfare, and has recently advised them to give $2.5m worth of grants to support corporate cage free campaigns. Prior to joining Open Philanthropy, he worked as Policy Advisor & International Liaison to the CEO at The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS). His other experience includes a position as a litigation fellow at HSUS and an associate consultant at Bain & Company. He has a B.A. from Harvard University in Social Studies and a JD from Yale Law School.
