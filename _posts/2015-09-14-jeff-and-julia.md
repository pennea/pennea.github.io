Jeff's a Google engineer. Julia's a mental health clinician. Together, they gave roughly half their income to fight global poverty in 2014. They're also married, with an extremely cute baby.

Jeff will discuss his career path from startup to Google, and he and Julia will explain how they arrived at their current altruistic philosophy and give an introduction to the growing Effective Altruism movement.

Both Jeff and Julia have very thoughtful blogs about Effective Altruism, Julia's is called [Giving Gladly](http://www.givinggladly.com/) and Jeff's is [here](http://www.jefftk.com/index). They have also been featured in the [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2013/05/31/join-wall-street-save-the-world/).
