Join the Future of Humanity Society as we eat delicious Greek Lady sandwiches and watch Ex Machina, a recent Hollywood movie about an artificial intelligence. 
Afterwords, we’ll have a mind-blowing discussion about real-world threats that could wipe out humanity, like nuclear weapons, nanotechnology, global epidemics, synthetic biology, and artificial intelligence.
