This talk will present a brief overview of the scientific evidence that the animals we eat have the capacity to suffer and why reducing their suffering should matter to effective altruists. Then, a series of infographic animations will survey the numbers of all categories of animals we eat â€” finfish, shellfish, birds and hoofed mammals. The presentation will include a number-centric overview of the lives of two representative animals we eat: salmon among aquatic animals and chickens among land animals. The presentation ends by trying to answer the question of whether donating to animal charities actually contributes to reducing animal suffering.

Harish Sethu is an Associate Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Drexel University, and an author of the blog, www.CountingAnimals.com. He is a long time animal advocate, and was featured in Peter Singer's recent book 'The Most Good You Can Do'.
