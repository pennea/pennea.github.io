One for the World has recently concluded its annual Charity Selection Process, and we want to share the results as part of Wharton Social Impact Week! 

Join us to learn more about our process for choosing effective charities and the short list of organizations we selected. Lunch will be served!

More about the event:

Rossa O'Keefe-O'Donovan, a 4th year Economics PhD student at UPenn will be running the session. His focus is on development economics, so this is his jam!

Students from Wharton undergrad, Wharton MBA, UPenn Law and the UPenn medical school all participated in the process as well, and will be presenting their findings on each of our recommended organizations.

Professor Corinne Low (Wharton BEPP department) and Kyle Sherman from the Center for High Impact Philanthropy have both given input throughout the process.
