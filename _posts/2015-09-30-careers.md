You’ll spend over 80,000 hours of your life working - you should make the most of them. But if you want to make a difference, what should you do? Work for nonprofits? Try to change policy? Find a malaria vaccine? Go into finance and give it all away?

Rob Wiblin and Roman Duda, researchers at 80,000 Hours, will try to show that by being very strategic you could have 1,000 times more impact than someone who never thinks things through.

Rob studied both genetics and economics at the Australian National University (ANU), graduating top of his class and being named Young Alumnus of the Year in 2015. He ‘earned to give’ as a research economist in various Australian Government agencies, and then moved to the UK to work at the Centre for Effective Altruism, first as Research Director and then Executive Director. He is also Secretary of the board of Animal Charity Evaluators and a member of the World Economic Forum’s Global Shapers Community.

Roman did a fully-funded Masters in Philosophy at Oxford, during which he also consulted for a top 30 FTSE company on their business strategy, whilst also studying Mandarin Chinese. With a strong interest in Quantified Self, he has worked at the start-ups Memrise and Self Spark.
