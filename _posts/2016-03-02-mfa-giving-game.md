Which charity should you give to in order to do the most good for animals? We will give each participant at this event $10 and let them decide which of three charities to donate it to. You will hear presentations about three charities: Mercy for Animals, The Nonhuman Rights Project and New Harvest. Alan Darer, Education Project Coordinator at Mercy For Animals, will join us to talk about the work they do, and the results they are achieving. Come to this fun, interactive event to find out about some of the most effective charities in the world, and how to evaluate their impact!

Pattaya's Thai food will be served!
