Individuals in the USA give a huge amount of money to charity each year ($227bn in 2009!) but only 32% do any research about where their money is going, and only 3% give based on teh relative performance of charities. Charitable giving to help animals is also sizeable, though the majority of donations go to organizations that run shelters for 'companion animals', while the vast majority of animals that are killed or otherwise abused in the US live on farms. 

Giving Games are a fun and interactive way to encourage people to think about the effectiveness of their charitable donations, and donate somebody else's (real!) money at the same time. Each participant will be given $10 to allocate to one of three charities. We will present information about the effectiveness of each organization, and then participants will discuss and analyze their relative effectiveness, before allocating $10 to their preferred organization.

This giving game will feature:
The Humane League
Animal Charity Evaluators
Hampton Creek
Come to find more about each of these great organizations, and decide which one will do the most good with $10!
