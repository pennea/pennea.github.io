We now have a fairly thriving EA community at Penn, with 5 groups actively working on various aspects of effective altruism:

- Giving What We Can: Penn
- One for the World (MBA and undergraduate)
- 80,000 Hours
- The Future of Humanity Society
- Penn Animal Advocacy

Each group will give a short 5 minute overview of their work this semester, and plans for next semester. The idea is to encourage collaboration and learning between groups, and hopefully to inspire us to keep growing this community. 

Join us for food and drink, to celebrate an excellent semester on Giving Tuesday, and to meet other effective altruists at Penn!
