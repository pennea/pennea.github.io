*The launch event of IMPACT’s latest issue on giving is hosted in partnership with Giving What We Can, and takes the form of a ‘Giving Game’. Participants will allocate money to one of two charities by considering evidence on how effectively they use donations.*  Rossa O’Keeffe-O’Donovan *and* Peter Buckley *explain how the game will work, and why it is a useful exercise.*

There are 1000s of charities out there, all asking for our donations. When we choose which charity we give to, it seems important to ask which charity will do the most good with our donation. But how do we know which charity is the ‘best’ when they all claim to be doing great things? And what evidence should we use when comparing charities?  

Giving Games are a fun way to encourage people to think carefully about which charities they give to, and to critically assess different types of evidence of a charity’s impact. For example, should we worry if a charity spends a significant proportion of its budget on ‘overheads’ or running costs?

For every participant in the Giving Game, $10 from an anonymous donor will be donated to one of two charities: Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI) or Give Directly. It is up to the participant to choose which charity this donation will go to, based on evidence presented and discussions with other participants in the game. 

To start things off, we give a brief overview of the two charities below, and links to further information. The launch event will be held on Wednesday 19th March at the LGBT Center, and starts at 7pm - see the Facebook event for more details. See you there!
