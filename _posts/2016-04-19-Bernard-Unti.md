How has the animal protection movement grown over the last 50 years? What can we learn from this history about recent successes and the future of the humane movement? We are delighted to have Bernard Unti speak on campus to address these questions!

Bernard Unti is the Senior Policy Advisor and Special Assistant to the President and CEO of the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS), the largest animal protection organization in the US. He is a recognized authority on the animal protection movement, and author of "Protecting All Animals: A Fifty-Year History of The Humane Society of the United States".

The event will be catered with vegan food from Hummus, and is kindly sponsored by Graduate and Professional Student Assembly (GAPSA)
