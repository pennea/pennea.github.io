Dr. Marieke Gartner, a postdoctoral fellow at the Philadelphia Zoo who received her Ph.D. in Psychology from Edinburgh, will speak about her project of measuring welfare at the Philadelphia Zoo. The Philadelphia Zoo recently installed an innovative system called "Zoo 360" which consists of enclosed pathways wandering around the zoo, allowing some of the animals to greatly expand their options for moving around: http://www.philadelphiazoo.org/Explore/Zoo360-Animal-Trails.htm . The Zoo believes this is a form of enrichment and would like to measure the welfare of animals to test this idea out, and that is why they hired Dr. Gartner. There are a lot of interesting epistemological and evaluative questions that can be raised about how one would go about measuring welfare in such a wide variety of animals, so this promises to be a fascinating talk!
