What’s the most effective way to do good? 
Effective Altruism (EA) is a growing social movement that applies evidence and reason to answer this question. 
Join the various effective altruist organizations at Penn as we explore the various areas of high potential impact, including health interventions for the global poor, charities working to reduce animal suffering on factory farms, and existential risk mitigation. 
Finally, we will consider how to pick careers that have the highest impact. 
This is a great opportunity for altruistically-minded students to learn about how to do the most good they can. 
Delicious food from Hip City Veg will be served!
